# Payback Calculation Program

## Overview
This Java application is designed to calculate the payback amount in different bill denominations. Given a payment amount and a price, it efficiently computes the change to be returned and breaks it down into various denominations such as $100, $50, $20, $10, $5, and $1 bills.

## Feature
- **Payback Calculation**: The program takes two inputs: the payment amount and the price of an item. It then calculates the change required and determines the number of bills needed for each denomination to make up the total change amount.

## Running the Program
To run the Payback Calculation Program, follow these steps:

1. **Compile the Java Program**:
   - Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
   - Navigate to the directory containing `Main.java`.
   - Use the command `javac Main.java` to compile the program.

2. **Execute the Program**:
   - Once compiled, run the program using `java Main`.
   - The output will display the change to be returned in different bill denominations.

## Example
- If the payment is $100 and the price is $73, the program will output the change in the highest possible denominations. For instance, it may output "1 $20 Bill(s), 1 $5 Bill(s), 2 $1 Bill(s)" indicating the way to return $27 as change.

## Contribution
Contributions to enhance and improve the Payback Calculation Program are encouraged. This can include adding support for additional currencies, optimizing the algorithm, or extending the program to include coin denominations.
